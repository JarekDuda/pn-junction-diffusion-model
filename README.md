Working diffusion (MERW) conductance model of diode as pn junction

While standard diffusion model are in disagreemnt with quantum predictions, especially [Anderson localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_localization) crucial for semiconductors, Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW) gives exactly the same stationary probability distribution as QM, thanks to being chosen accordingly to the [maximal entropy principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy), crucial for statistical physics model.
